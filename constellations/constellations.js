The first one was in 389 AD and was recorded to be as bright as Venus. The other shone brighter than Altair, the brightest star in Aquila. A nova is what the ancients called a "new star." In reality, it is not a new star at all, but a very old one that suddenly becomes bright again, regaining some of the former glory of its youth. Note that there is a very strong difference between a nova (an old star brightening temporarily) and a supernova (a massive star exploding).'

The god Hermes beame angered by this and sent a ram to carry the two children to safety. Tragically, Helle lost her grip and tumbled from the ram into the narrow strip of water between Europe and Asia, now called Hellespont in her honor. Phrixus, on the other hand, arrived safely to the shores of the Black Sea where he sacrificed the ram and gave its fleece to a sleepless dragon for safe-keeping. Later, Jason and his intrepid Argonauts recovered the prized fleece and returned it to Thessaly'

Even the Greeks were not clear on its history. The first reference to the name Boötes comes from "The Odyssey" by Homer almost three millenia ago. In one of his most popular incarnations, he is called the Hunter and, with his Hounds (Canes Venatici), he eternally circles the Bears, Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, around the North Pole. In fact, the brightest star in Boötes is Arcturus, which can be loosely translated as "Bear Guard." He is also called the Herdsman and his journey around the pole represents his task of keeping the celestial beasts together. Another legend says that Bootes was the son of Zeus and Callisto. Hera changed Callisto into a bear who was almost killed by Boötes when he was out hunting. Luckily, she was rescued by Zeus and he took her into the sky where she is now Ursa Major, the Great Bear. Yet another myth says that he was the son of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture. Supposedly he was given a place in the sky for inventing the plow.'

Cancer grabbed onto the hero\'s toe with its claws, but barely breaking the rhythm of his great battle with Hydra, Hercules crushed the crab with his foot. Hera, grateful for the little crustacean\'s heroic but pitiful effort, gave it a place in the sky. Cancer is famous despite itself due to its Zodiacal origins.

    description: 'One of the 12 constellations. Leo is the Nemean Lion which was killed by Hercules on one of his great quests. Legend says that the lion had a hide that could not punctured by iron, bronze or stone. Since he couldn\'t reason with the ferocious beast, Hercules strangled it to death and the local people were very grateful. The Chaldeans associated Leo with the sun since it is in the sky during the summer solstice (although this is no longer true, due to the precession of the Earth\'s axis). Since Nile floods around this time, the ancient Egyptians worshipped the celestial lion. You can find Leo in the sky by looking for the "sickle" starting at Regulus (Alpha Leonis) and following the backwards question mark. To find Regulus, use the Big Dipper as described on the Ursa Major Page. In more modern times (late 1600\'s that is!), Johannes Hevelius added the constellation Leo Minor.'
